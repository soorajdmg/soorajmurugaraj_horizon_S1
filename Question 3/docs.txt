      necessary output

How to run my code?
    - Create a new package in your workspace and a folder named "src" in it aswell
    - In the "src" folder, add these code files
    - Modify the "CMakeLlists.txt" present in the package folder, change dependency names
    - Write the command "catkin_make" in your workspace directory
    - Turn on the master with the command "roscore"
    - Then simply run the "publisher" and "subscriber" nodes in 2 different terminals

What this subscriber-publisher system does?
    - The publisher node is a node that publishes a headline onto the topic "News"
    - The data it uses is from the "subpub/headline", which has a string field named "headline"
    - The subscriber node is subscribed to the topic "News" and hence receives the message published
      by the publisher
    - When this node receives the message it callbacks with the data received.
    - The data being transferred is a News-headline
    - The working video is attached in the Google form given
